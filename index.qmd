## Hi, Iâ€™m Catherine ðŸ‘‹, and I am a UX Designer based in Toronto, Canada.

Iâ€™m currently a third year student in the Bachelors of Information program at the University of Toronto. I have experience in few fields such as User Experience Design, Graphic Design, Illustration and Social Media Marketing! Apart from my studies, Iâ€™m also a huge Formula 1 fan and love watching races as much as I can!
